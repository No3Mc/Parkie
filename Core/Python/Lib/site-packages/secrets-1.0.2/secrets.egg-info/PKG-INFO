Description: 
        = Tiny utilities for password generation and management =
        
        This is a simple wrapper for passwords related tasks, including:
        
        - Configure models to map LDAP servers and password DNs to services
        - Change passwords for these LDAP services
        - Generate random passwords with urandom seeded OpenSSL session
        
        = TODO =
        
        Later I would like to extend this to be able to create,modify and delete
        LDAP users with same 'LDAP servers' model.
